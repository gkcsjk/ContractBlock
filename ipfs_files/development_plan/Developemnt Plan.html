<h1>Blockchain Contract Platform Development</h1>

<h3>Main idea:</h3> 
<p>Ethereum DApp (Decentralized Application) Development</p>
<h3>System Structure:</h3>
<img src="project_structure.jpg">
<h3>Platforms and languages:</h3>
<h5>Web:</h5>
<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, React</p>
<h5>Blockchain:</h5>
<p>Soliity, Remix, geth...</p>
<h5>Data:</h5>
<p>IPFS, MongoDB</p>
<h3>Functions:</h3>
<p>Two or more parties can reach agreements (contracts) and write them into the block chain, which are permanent and unchangeable.</p>
<ul>
	<li>User registration</li>
	<li>Mining or purchasing Ether</li>
	<li>Generate, view, delete, modify contract off chain <b>and</b> upload/synchronize contracts to blockchain (consuming Ether)</li>
	<li>Transfer Ether between users</li>
	<li>Blocks explorer (for demo)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Always save big files to IPFS. IPFS will return its unique Hash. Using this Hash in IPFS distributed web can access the related data. It can reduce the data written to blockchain, which will consume Ether.</p>
<p>Writing data to blockchain will consume Ether (Gas). Therefore, users need to have Ether in their account to make sure they can support their data writing. Reading data from blockchain does not consume Ether.</p>
<p>Users can get Ether from mining or transferring from other accounts. In the real chain, mining can be very difficult and consume a lot of system resources. But in this project, we may build a private chain which makes mining kind of easy.</p>
